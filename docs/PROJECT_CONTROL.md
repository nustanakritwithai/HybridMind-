## Release priorities

**P0 — Editorial foundation**
- [x] Confirm WordPress credentials via connected WordPress.com tools.
- [x] Create four core editorial categories.
- [x] Created homepage #16, Smart Glasses #17 and explainer #18; published only homepage #16 with owner approval.
- [ ] Review actual Gutenberg rendering in authenticated preview.
- [ ] Create original brand imagery and site logo with rights cleared.
- [ ] Create editorial policy, About, Contact, Privacy and Affiliate Disclosure.
- [x] Configure static homepage, navigation and brand header/footer after explicit approval.
- [ ] Enable public launch only after approval and QA.

**P1 — Content readiness**
- [ ] Verify official sources/specs for recommended smart glasses.
- [ ] Confirm Shopee Affiliate approved channel, links, prices, returns and commissions.
- [ ] Prepare verified buying-guide launch article and images.
- [ ] Configure analytics and outbound-click measurement.

**P2 — AI newsroom**
- [ ] Review AI Engine & Uncanny Automator settings in a safe environment.
- [ ] Introduce article-state pipeline: DISCOVERED → VERIFIED → DRAFTED → REVIEWED → APPROVED → PUBLISHED.
- [ ] Test drafting workflow with restricted WordPress role.
- [ ] Apply source evidence and no duplicate-content rules.

## Gate: UNKNOWN ≠ PASS

- A completed draft is not an approved story.
- A model-generated product image is not a true product photograph.
- Shopee product-listing presence is not live stock or affiliate program approval.
- No passwords, API keys, account tokens, customer data or unpublished personal contact details in this public repository.
- Don't publish a WordPress page or alter site-wide templates/settings without direct instruction.
- Link to a GitHub Pages preview only after confirming it is actually accessible.

## Next step

Inspect the WordPress static homepage in an authenticated browser on mobile and compare with the GitHub design prototype. Smart Glasses Hub and explainer remain drafts. The final public launch is a separate deliberate approval.
